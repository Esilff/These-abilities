# These-abilities
A prototype add-on for unity with the goal of helping developpers include features for disabled people.
This add-on was realized in a short time for a school project and provides the following tools.

- Fullscreen Shader Pass injection at runtime for color blindness.
- Basic emitter / listener interaction with colliders in order to retrieve sound sources positions relative to the player
forward vector. This is used for deaf people.
